# html-email-boilerplate
My own responsive HTML email boilerplate code, derived from the popular MailChimp boilerplate and developed over the course of a year of building regular responsive HTML email campaigns for clients like Liverpool FC, Adidas and D-Link.

Includes industry-tested client-specific resets and fixes.
